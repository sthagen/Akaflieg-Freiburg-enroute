==============================

The page **SatNav Positioning** provides status information on the satellite
positioning system. To access the page, open the main menu and choose
"Information/SatNav Positioning."


Status

This field shows the data connection currently used and lists the types of data
presently received.


Position
--------

This field shows the position reported by the satellite navigation system.


True Altitude

This field shows the true altitude reported by the satellite navigation system.

True altitude AGL or AMSL is the vertical distance from the aircraft to the
terrain or to the main sea level, respectively.

.. warning:: 
   True altitude is not the same as barometric altitude, which is the altitude
   shown on your aircraft's altimeter. Depending on weather conditions, true
   altitude and barometric altitude may differ substantially. Never use true
   altitude to judge the vertical distance from your aircraft to an airspace
   boundary.


Other
-----

The last field on the page shows the timestamp of the last position report. If
available, it also shows the magnetic variation for your current position.
